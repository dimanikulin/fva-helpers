Sometimes a search gives you no results — even if you *know* the photo exists.  

Common reasons:
- The **person** isn’t tagged in the photo.
- The **location** wasn’t saved when you took it.
- There’s a **typo** in the search term.
- The search tool doesn’t understand **synonyms** (e.g. “dog” vs “puppy”).

✅ **Try this instead:**
- Use more general words first.
- Remove extra details and narrow down after you get results.
- Search by date or event name instead of by person.
