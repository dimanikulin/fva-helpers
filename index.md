# 📖 Narrative

Imagine your mom just got back from a vacation and can’t find any of her beach photos. She opens her photo app and scrolls... nothing. Panic. She’s not technical—searching by date or place doesn’t come naturally. Syncing with cloud services? Forget it.

This site is built for users like her: people who just want a helpful, calming walkthrough of how to recover their precious memories. No jargon. No pop-ups. Just answers.
It walks you through how photo search actually works — not just the features, but the quirks. You’ll learn how to use filters, why some photos don’t show up, and how to get better results every time.

In just a few scrolls, even the most inexperienced user can feel like a search pro — no downloads, no tech lingo, no frustration.

# 1️⃣ What You *Can* Search
Photo search works best when it has clues about your pictures.  
Most search tools use **metadata** — little bits of information stored with your photos.

You can usually search by:
- **People** – “Photos of Sarah”
- **Places** – “Paris 2019”
- **Events** – “Birthday party”
- **Objects** – “Beach” or “Dog”
- **Dates** – “July 4th, 2022”

💡 *Tip: Use short, clear words. If you’re looking for a wedding photo, try “Wedding 2020” before adding extra details.*

# 2️⃣ Why a Search Might Not Work

Sometimes a search gives you no results — even if you *know* the photo exists.  

Common reasons:
- The **person** isn’t tagged in the photo.
- The **location** wasn’t saved when you took it.
- There’s a **typo** in the search term.
- The search tool doesn’t understand **synonyms** (e.g. “dog” vs “puppy”).

✅ **Try this instead:**
- Use more general words first.
- Remove extra details and narrow down after you get results.
- Search by date or event name instead of by person.

# 3️⃣ Using Filters

Filters help you narrow down results so you don’t have to scroll forever.

Common filters include:
- **People** – Choose a specific person’s face.
- **Date** – Pick a single day, month, or year.
- **Location** – Search for photos taken in a city or country.

💡 *Example: “Photos of Anna” + “Paris” + “2018”*  
This will show all photos of Anna in Paris during 2018.

# 4️⃣ Troubleshooting: When All Else Fails

If you still can’t find the photo:

1. ✅ Try a simpler search.  
2. ✅ Check that the photo actually exists in your album.  
3. ✅ Search by the **month/year** instead of the exact day.  
4. ✅ Look in your “Albums” or “Favorites” folders.  
5. ✅ Make sure the app has permission to see all your photos.

# 5️⃣ Stay Organized for Easier Future Searches

A few habits now can save you hours later:

- Tag people when your app asks you to.  
- Allow location access so photos get tagged with where they were taken.  
- Use albums to group photos from trips, events, or people.  
- Mark important pictures as “Favorites.”  
- Back up properly.

# 📌 Recap
You don’t need to be a tech expert to find your favorite photos.  
Start with simple searches, use filters, and remember — the more organized your photos are, the easier it will be next time.
