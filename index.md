# So What You Can Search
Photo search works best when it has clues about your pictures.  
Most search tools use **metadata** — little bits of information stored with your photos.

You can usually search by:
- **People** – “Photos of Sarah”
- **Places** – “Paris 2019”
- **Events** – “Birthday party”
- **Objects** – “Beach” or “Dog”
- **Dates** – “July 4th, 2022”

💡 *Tip: Use short, clear words. If you’re looking for a wedding photo, try “Wedding 2020” before adding extra details.*
