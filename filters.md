Filters help you narrow down results so you don’t have to scroll forever.

Common filters include:
- **People** – Choose a specific person’s face.
- **Date** – Pick a single day, month, or year.
- **Location** – Search for photos taken in a city or country.

💡 *Example: “Photos of Anna” + “Paris” + “2018”*  
This will show all photos of Anna in Paris during 2018.
